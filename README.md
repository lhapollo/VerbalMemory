# VerbalMemory

This is a project that tests your memory. There will be words that pop up, and your task is to figure out if it's a word you've already seen before, or if it's a new word.

The project was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with fonts from Google Fonts.

The project was inspired by the Human Benchmark test of the same function, found [here](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/verbal-memory).
